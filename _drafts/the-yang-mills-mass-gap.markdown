I never understood clearly what a mass gap is,
and what it means physically.

But I know it has to do with an energy difference
between the fundamental and first excited state,
this seems so natural, but maybe
it has to be demonstrated for Yang-Mills,
while it has been demonstrated for other
theories,
maybe it has to do with a single ground state.

And I know it has to do with the exponential decay
of correlation functions too.

Read it and talk about what you learned
