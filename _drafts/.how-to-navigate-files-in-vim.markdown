There is a [Vim wiki][wiki], the link goes specifically to the file explorer page.

`:Explore` displays the folder explore window.

`Ctrl-6` takes you back and forth to explore and file window.

This is my endeavor to find a text editor that is light.
Atom is impossibly heavy, but plain text editors cannot be that heavy,
that is an absurd.

Another thing I would like to have in Vim is autocomplete for Latex/HTML.
