I am a researcher in physics, currently a postdoc fellow at [ENS de Lyon][ensphy], interested in the fields of statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics and turbulence. I am working on the modeling of statistical aspects of Navier-Stokes turbulence.

I completed my PhD in physics at [IF-UFRJ][ufrjfi], located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I studied analytical and numerical approaches to large deviations in models of fluid turbulence, in collaboration with [Luca Moriconi][lmori].

Here you can find my publications, PhD thesis, open source projects, and some blog posts on different topics of math and physics.
