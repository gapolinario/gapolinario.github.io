Researcher in physics, currently a postdoc at [ENS de Lyon][ensphy], and working on the modelling of statistical aspects of Navier-Stokes turbulence.

I obtained my physics PhD at [IF-UFRJ][ufrjfi], located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I studied analytical and numerical approaches to large deviations in models of fluid turbulence, in collaboration with [Luca Moriconi][lmori].
