I am a researcher in physics, currently a postdoc fellow at the University of Bayreuth, in Germany, working with [Michael Wilczek][wilc]. I am interested in the fields of statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics and turbulence, and I'm working on the modeling of statistical aspects of Navier-Stokes turbulence.

Previously, I did my PhD in physics at [IF-UFRJ][ufrjfi] and a postdoc at the [ENS de Lyon][ensphy].

Here you can find my publications, PhD thesis, open source projects, and some blog posts on different topics of math and physics.
