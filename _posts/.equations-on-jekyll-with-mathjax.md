First I had to

```
sudo gem install redcarpet pygments.rb
```

But this does not solve, although more than one website said it did.

Now there is report of an error which is:
The computer says you need redcarpet, though you actually need rouge
I have installed rouge, but the problem persists


Notice that the link to Dason Kurkiewicz is incorrect in Gaston page,
[this][dasonk] is the correct link.

This is the full process.

And this is a test \\( sin(x^2) \\) on an inline equation

And on a detached express

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
