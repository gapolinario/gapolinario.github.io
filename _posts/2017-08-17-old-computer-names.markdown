olinda: Dell Inspiron 14, my first laptop. Named after the city in Italo Calvino's
The Invisible Cities, not after the city in Pernambuco, although it did influence.
Angelo at UFF helped me install my first Linux system, an Ubuntu. There were later
changes. I used Linux Mint for some time. This was the time I learned how to
write programs.


toto: A desktop at home that ran ubuntu for a little while, I wanted it to run fast but
installed a linux system with unity, I have learned much since then. Named after
the dog of Dorothy.


kombi: IBM computer at UFRJ, running Ubuntu 15, it was quite slow.


chevy: IBM computer was partitioned, and was running antergos under this name.
I wanted it to run faster, so I installed this Antergos XFCE, at first it looked very ugly,
but I watched some videos, did some research and managed a quite pretty customization,
similar to the one I am running now on deluge. An old computer deserves a standard name,
this is the reason behind kombi and chevy, though chevy was sleek and intended to ride
faster (due to XFCE).


sopwithcamel: HP Pavillion under dual boot with windows 8, running Linux Mint KDE, it
was not really stable. One day I installed Virtual Box on it, the next day it wouldn't
start the graphics. This was quite a story, but lead me to a path of changing and learning.
It was named after the Peanuts stories, Snoopy often dreams of being a WWI pilot,
where he flies a Sopwith Camel. The Red Baron was his recurring enemy.


redbaron: A sandisk 32GB thumb drive. It is mentioned for two reasons. It is a thumbdrive
of large storage which helps a lot at college. And it has a customized name.

deluge: Dell XPS at UFRJ, ran Ubuntu Gnome for a short while, but it was unstable, later
changed to standard Ubuntu with Gnome Shell. Gnome was heavily customized. Named after
Da Vinci's painting of a flood in Italy, used for my calculations in turbulence.
Using Papyrus icons.

byrne: HP Pavillion, my first full installation of a Linux system. Even works with
an extra monitor (a TV, connected through HDMi, even the sound plays right).
After David Byrne. Icons here are Ultra-Flat.
