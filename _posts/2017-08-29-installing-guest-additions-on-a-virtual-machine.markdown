This does not look good, some problems might come up.
Take a look at <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-on-a-gui-less-ubuntu-server-host/">
this</a> and <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm">this</a>
tutorials, the ask ubuntu tutorial is more GUI oriented.
The first time I tried to do this, it didn't work all that well.
