The Art Assignment channel published this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STW0eZDsKVg">
The Case for Land Art</a>, to make us think about the purpose and endeavor of Land Art, a sort of art
form which interacts with the natural world, either by displacing its elements to a gallery environment,
or by making art work directly in the environment.

The first instance of Land Art I heard about was A Line Made by Walking, by Richard Long, and it is
mentioned in the video (1:52), this and other works are in the Will Gompertz book, "Isso Ã© arte?".
What Richard Long was walk on a straigth line on grass until his footsteps marked a line on the ground.
When I read about it in the book, I didn't look for the picture, and what I imagined was a curved line,
more like paths in a farm, leading somewhere. This is a more geometric, artsy and detached shape.
The straigth line reminds us that this is only art, and is not leading anywhere, this is not a short
path or a necessary path, this is just a path.

It also mentions there is a spectrum of what is Land Art and what is not. This led me to think about
the Inhotim museum, which touches several aspects of contemporary art. For instance, it has several
gardens, and there was another text I read these days which mentioned several artists who
planned gardens. On a grander view, Roberto Burle Marx planned the whole museum, which has a series
of marked (with stones) or unmarked (footsteps only) paths, winding and bifurcating. On a smaller,
more specific view, there is a garden designed by Yayoi Kusama, with several floating sivler balls
on the water.

And there is all the art around Inhotim. Some are sculptures, or works of art laid out on the grass,
these are distinctely marked as artworks, and while not detached from their environment, they
are distinct. This is art on the land, but it is not land art. There are several giant pavillions,
which act on a larger scale just like the sculptures. But there is the slide. A huge slide built
on art. There are the brick letters and the names spread on the grass. There is the beam drop,
taking away from the landscapes of the city (concrete) and putting it in the wild, a sea of
concrete and concrete beams.

An artist whom, on several occasions in Inhotim, interacts with the land is Olafur Elliason. There
is the kaleidoscope, used for observing the environment. And there is the igloo, it is small and composes
the environment around it with a psychedelic blinking fountain (inside), and a silvery unearthy igloo
on the outside.

Throughout all of the Inhotim, there are instances of art interacting with the environment in varied ways,
sometimes more as land art, sometimes less. This only illustrates the wide spectrum of uses artists
can make of their environment. Probably, the great attraction to all audiences produced by Inhotim
is in great part due to the mixture of nature so wide and open which are a rare view in the city,
and man made sites, more common to the sight, but at the same time so strange, so unusual,
so purposeless and useless in their strange shapes and materials.
