Mathematica has a d-dimensional Levi Civita tensor defined as

```
LeviCivitaTensor[d]
```

But to define one, you could go the following way

<<Combinatorica`

e[x_, x_, y_] = 0
e[x_, y_, x_] = 0
e[y_, x_, x_] = 0

This is specific to 3 dimensions and gets exponentially
hard to do for higher dimensions, there must be a better way

r = e[x__] -> SignaturePermutation[List[x]]

This uses SignaturePermutation, which is contained only
in the Combinatorica package, which is strange, such a simple
function only on a package.

Then one can run this rule over any expression and it works.

But there is a better way of doing it.

Then I'm going to present the other derivation using

Lev=Normal[LeviCivitaTensor[3]]

applied to some matrices

in particular, for this derivation, run

s[l1_, l2_, l3_] :=
 Sum[Lev[[i, j, k]] d[l1, i] d[l2, j] d[l3, k], {i, 3}, {j, 3}, {k,
   3}]

And precisely we have the equality

s[#1, #2, #3] == (Det[matD] Lev[[#1, #2, #3]]) & @@ {3, 2, 1}
