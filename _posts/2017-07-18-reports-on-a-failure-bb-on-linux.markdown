I tried to install the security module for Banco do Brasil in Linux. They have an executable,
which you can just download, make executable and run, and also have a .deb package.
From the website, it looks like they showed real interest in doing something that works easily
for Linux. In the past, we had to install Java from Oracle for the bank software to work.
Apparently not anymore, the only problem is that I tried both approaches and none of them
worked.
I should try one more time, but so far BB has failed me on the computer.
