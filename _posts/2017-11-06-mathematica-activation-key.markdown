On the [Wolfram User][user] website, you can view all
your Wolfram products. But if you have more than one
activation key, this is not going to remind you which
key belongs to which computer. (Or it may remind you, but
I don't know how).

But your activation key is also a variable stored in
the Mathematica notebook, under the name

    $ActivationKey

I found this and yet another way to view your keys
in the official [wolfram website][key].
