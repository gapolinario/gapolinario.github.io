First, one should learn what the
<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a>
acronym means. It applies here, so "this is not legal advice" to myself.

<a href="https://choosealicense.com/no-license/">This</a> was the best text
I found which commented the issue on whether or not to include a license
on my content and which one should I choose. This comes down to two main
points in my view.

The first one is whether there is copyrighted or licensed content on my website.
If it is copyrighted, I might not have the right to use it.
If it is licensed, I might not have the right to choose a more restrictive
license

The second point is what is my intent with the content.
If I don't include any license, it is implied that the content IS
copyrighted, but if I want to share the code, it is natural
to include a license which makes that clear.
And this is the intent of the content I share on Github.

A last point to make is that some <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">CC</a>
licenses should not be used for software, because they do not include
any requirements on source code.
Rather, there is the permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.
CC licenses should be used for other creative content, instead.

Most of this I learned at <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose a License</a>.
