Since I started building my website, I have learned much about web development
and I even look critically at webpages in general, especially to webpages of physicists.
I have a blog post on that topic (which I can't link to, because this page
is very static so far, but it should get better in the future.)


If you are just beginning, Codecademy is the best place to start. The basic is learning
HTML and CSS to have a page and to build its style. Some bootstrap, if you want your web
page to be responsive (responsive is a tech-savy keyword, means that your page works
on any device: desktop, smartphone, tablet, ipod, projecting screens).


If you want interactivity, you'd want to learn some Javascript and jQuery. jQuery is a
Javascript library which makes things easier, because programming in pure Javascript
is a difficult mission.
