A detailed explanation can be found [here][deep].
All other explanations mention a `_layouts` folder,
or change the Markdown parser to Redcarpet, Maruku or some other,
nothing of this or any installation was needed,
I just had to create the `_includes` directory
and add some files, as described.

Now I display the same formula twice for your appreciation:

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

\\[ \sin(x^2) +\cos(x^2) = 1 \\]
