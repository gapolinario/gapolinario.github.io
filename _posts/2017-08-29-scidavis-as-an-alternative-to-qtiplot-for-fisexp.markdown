QtiPlot has a restricted trial version and this is not
best practices for a public brazilian university, which should
be using free software, just like any public institution.
The whole world is moving to free software, except for Brasil,
which is moving backwards.

But <a href="http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/">SciDavis</a> is open source
and can be easily installed in Ubuntu computers, directly from apt-get

    sudo apt-get install scidavis

And there is the further improvement that one does not need to pronounce it
wrong like "qitplot". Well, I should try and do histograms and
linear fits on it to see if they are really easy.
