Maybe you have a number, like 2.5066282746, and feel like it is a special combination
of standard mathematical constants, maybe $e$ and $\pi$ arranged in a special manner,
or some other strange combination of 
How do you find out? This is the magic that inverse symbolic calculators do.

I first heard about them on [Explain XKCD][2] when discussing [this comic][1].

[RIES][3] is an inverse symbolic calculator which you can use on your computer,
but for that you have to download and compile the code. I did not try to do that.

The [ISC][4] is another option, where you only need the browser.

Have fun.
