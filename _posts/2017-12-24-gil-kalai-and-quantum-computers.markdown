The matematician Gil Kalai once again [comments][kalai-quantum]
on his disbelief in the feasibility of quantum computers.

In the near future, 50-qubit quantum computers without error
correction are going to be tested by [IBM][mit-ibm] and [Google][mit-google].
If it works, they would give strong evidence on the exponential
speedup made possible by quantum computers.
But the same code, with error correction added, would
require between 100 and 500 qubits.

This is where the main criticism of Kalai stands,
stating that these numbers might be impossible to reach
due to technological barriers.
But technological limits are famous for being broken.
Even if superconducting qubits reveal not suited
for large scale quantum computers, other approaches might
work.

Whereas Scott Aaronson, in a link to his blog I have lost,
states that testing quantum mechanics to such
incredible precision is one of the main interests in
building a quantum computer.
And even if it is not, other theories we uncover might
still be more powerful than quantum mechanics.
