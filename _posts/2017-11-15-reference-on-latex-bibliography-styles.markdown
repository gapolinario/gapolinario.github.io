So far, I have not found exactly the bibliography style
I would like on my articles, but I have found a [good
reference][bibtex] with several examples of bibtex styles.

Those most similar to what I want are: plain, amsplain and acm.
What I would like to find out is how to edit these styles
and make my own.
