A list of references and curiosities. I started paying attention to this subject
recently, when I started building my own personal webpage. Some are very good and served
as inspiration. Others are pure html, no css involved. The list is heavily biased
towards field theory and statistical mechanics practitioners.

- <a href="http://www.if.ufrj.br/~rodrigomp/index.html">Rodrigo Pereira, UFPE</a>, has a mountain picture too
- <a href="http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JohnCardy/">John Cardy</a>, an example of pure html,
has a mountain picture
- <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/">Gerard t'Hooft</a>, pure html with some gifs
- <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/">Daniel V. Schroeder</a>, has a javascript course and little
css actually used
- <a href="http://www.ifsc.usp.br/~rpereira/">Rodrigo Pereira, IFSC</a>, a neat and clean page
- <a href="http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~schwartz/index">Matthew Schwartz</a>
- <a href="http://barabasi.com/">Albert-László Barabasi</a>, top contender so far
- <a href="http://www.ihes.fr/~duminil/">Hugo Duminil-Copin</a>, mathematician, pretty page
- [Szabolcs Horvat][szabolcs], the Mathematica guy.
- [Celina M. H. de Figueiredo][celina], great website and influential brazilian researcher in graphs and complexity, did her DSc at UFRJ
- [Carneggie Melon U. Physics Dept.][carneggie], not a physicist's website, but a very organized
  institional website, easy to navigate through areas and get to know each researcher's work.
  Great interface for students to get to know the university.
- [Marcin Kotowski][kotowski]: Pretty and simple matematician page
- [Piotr Migdal][pmigdal]: Quantum physics, deep learning
- [François G. Schmitt][fgschmitt]: Turbulence, mentions current status of past PhD students
