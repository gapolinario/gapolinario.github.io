To begin with, the Wolfram blog has [this post][wolf-10] with some great tips
on how to use Mathematica better.

Then, there ton of useful questions, with long answers, on Mathematica Stack Exchange.
Take a look at these: [1][se-pitfalls], [2][se-good], [3][se-scoping], [4][se-for] and [5][se-performance].

The questions even have some links in them.
