> I'm writing a poem right now about a nose. I've always wanted to write a poem about a nose. But it's a ludicrous subject. That's why, when I was younger, I was afraid of [writing] something that didn't make a lot of sense. But now I'm not. I have nothing to worry about. It doesn't matter."

Saint Augustine

> To survive, you must tell stories.

Umberto Eco

> Psychologist Lisa Marie Bobby says the relatively low rate of male solo travel has a lot to do with how men relate to their partners. Men, she says, do relationships through activities. Their way of bonding with another person may involve playing video games or going bowling, whereas women bond through conversation and often by simply passing time with one another. So when men think of traveling, they think to do it as a pair or group activity. She adds that men also aren’t the most proactive. “Sometimes, when left to their own devices, men don’t do things,” she says. 

> The gender disparity could also be because the desire to better yourself through self-reflection is something women are psychologically more prone to do, Bobby explains. “Not always, but many times, men tend to be less self-aware and less connected to ‘Who am I? What makes me happy? What do I want to get out of my life?’ kinds of questions,” she says.

> We haven’t time to spare to hear whether it was between Italy and Sicily that he ran into a storm or somewhere outside the world we know–when every day we’re running into our own storms, spiritual storms, and driven by vice into all the troubles that Ulysses ever knew.

Seneca

> One day Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a Cheshire cat in a tree. ‘Which road do I take?’ she asked. ‘Where do you want to go?’ was his response. ‘I don’t know,’ Alice answered. ‘Then,’ said the cat, ‘it doesn’t matter.

  happen to them. They went out and happened to things.

Leonardo da Vinci

> Do I contradict myself?
  Very well then I contradict myself,
  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Walt Whitman, “Song of myself“, 1855

Michael Harris p.30, p.34

> Não. Sou um pouco como [o documentarista Eduardo] Coutinho,
 alguém à espera de querer acreditar, sem conseguir.
 Às vezes eu ia à igreja naquele espírito do Pascal:
 se você quer acreditar, primeiro fique de joelhos.
 Imaginando que, ao me submeter ao ritual, isso prepararia
 o caminho para recuperar uma fé que talvez eu tenha tido
 quando era muito novo e que depois eu perdi.
 Essa inquietação em relação a não encontrar sentido nas
 coisas se torna mais aguda quando o sentido não é lhe
 dado de fora para dentro. É mais fácil enfrentar a dissolução
 da intensidade quando você tem transcendência.
 Como não tenho, ela precisa ser encontrada no ato de fazer, criar.

> According to Tishby, who views the information bottleneck as a fundamental principle behind learning, whether you’re an algorithm, a housefly, a conscious being, or a physics calculation of emergent behavior, that long-awaited answer “is that the most important part of learning is actually forgetting.”

> When everything seems to be set
to show me off as a man of intelligence,
the fool I keep concealed on my person
takes over my talk and occupies my mouth

Pablo Neruda, We Are Many, 1967

>       Most people who quote Einstein’s declaration that “God does not play dice” seem not to realize that
	a dice-playing God would be an improvement over the actual situation.

>	I remember simple things, I remember how I could not understand simple things, this makes me a teacher.

> 	Stanley Kubrick shares with Orson Welles and Carl Dreyer the
	role of the Great Confounder — remaining supremely himself
	while frustrating every attempt to anticipate his next move
	or to categorize it once it registers.

Jonathan Rosenbaum, in the Full Metal Jacket [review][rosenbaum-kubrick]

>       And there's something intriguing about the way that we as humans can
        pull ourselves outside of system, and this actually has been used by
        some to suggest that this is why human consciouness is actually much
        more than just an analog computer, because how can an analog computer
        pull itself out of the system that it is stuck within, yet we seem to
        be able to shift from outside the system to see meaning of that
        sentence, go inside of the system, prove that it can't be proved
        (...).

Marcus du Sautoy, in a Numberphile video on
[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem][godel-marcus].

>      I don't know. I think I'm sick. And I don't know if my ailment has a name.
       It's just me sitting and staring at the Internet or the television...
       for long periods of time interspersed by trying to not do that.
       And then lying about what I've been doing.
       Then I'll get so excited about something that the excitement overwhelms me...
       and I can't sleep or do anything. And I just am in love with everything...
       but can't figure out how to make myself work in the world.

Brooke, in Mistress America (2015, dir: Noah Baumbach)

> 	You might well ask yourself: Why? Why do you do all of that?
	Why don't you just get it right the first time?
	Well, the problem is, we know we're gonna be wrong, and ...
	if we don't allow ourselves to be wrong, we're never gonna
	do anything new, we're just gonna rely on things that we know
	work. So, for us, making mistakes is an essential part of
	our process, we're not embarassed by it, in fact, we plan for it.

Pete Docter, Westminster Town Hall (2015), extract from [this video essay][edit-animated]
