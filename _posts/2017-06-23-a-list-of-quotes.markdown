>	Não. Sou um pouco como [o documentarista Eduardo] Coutinho,
	alguém à espera de querer acreditar, sem conseguir.
	Às vezes eu ia à igreja naquele espírito do Pascal:
	se você quer acreditar, primeiro fique de joelhos.
	Imaginando que, ao me submeter ao ritual, isso prepararia
	o caminho para recuperar uma fé que talvez eu tenha tido
	quando era muito novo e que depois eu perdi.
	Essa inquietação em relação a não encontrar sentido nas
	coisas se torna mais aguda quando o sentido não é lhe
	dado de fora para dentro. É mais fácil enfrentar a dissolução
	da intensidade quando você tem transcendência.
	Como não tenho, ela precisa ser encontrada no ato de fazer, criar.

>	When everything seems to be set

>       Most people who quote Einstein’s declaration that “God does not play dice” seem not to realize that

>       And there's something intriguing about the way that we as humans can
        pull ourselves outside of system, and this actually has been used by
        some to suggest that this is why human consciouness is actually much
        more than just an analog computer, because how can an analog computer
        pull itself out of the system that it is stuck within, yet we seem to
        be able to shift from outside the system to see meaning of that
        sentence, go inside of the system, prove that it can't be proved
        (...).

Marcus du Sautoy, in a Numberphile video on
[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem][godel-marcus].
