Quote from Philipe Roche's website:

Publication policy since 2002

To choose the Journals where we submit our manuscripts, we adopted the 3 following guidelines :

- Firstly, we restrict ourselves to journals with a copyright transfer agreement classified in the category "Green" (can archive pre-print and post-print) by the Sherpa - Romeo project. We indeed consider that public-funded research results should remain freely and easily accessible to the public. Our manuscripts are downloadable from open-archives (arXiv and/or HAL).
- Secondly, we favour journals belonging to non-profit Scientific Societies (EPS, IOP, APS, AIP, ...) rather than journals of profit-driven editors (Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer/Springer, Thomson Scientific, Nature Publishing Group , Taylor and Francis...) or private ones (Cambridge University Press,...). The difference in pricing between these 2 sets of publications in one reason, others reasons include support to scientific societies and repeated scientific misconducts of many commercial editors.
- Thirdly, we favour journals with a large diffusion but avoid those with a position of quasi-monopoly. We believe that monopolies or quasi-monopolies, such as the present situation in Physics in the Letter category, is dangerous because of the bias it inevitably sets biases across scientific communities and funding agencies.

This policy excludes: J Stat Phys (Springer), Physica A (Elsevier), J Fluid Mech (Cambridge), Nuclear Physics B (Elsevier)

And it includes: J. Stat. Mech. (SISSA/IOP), Phys. Rev. E (APS), Phys. Rev. Fluids (APS), J. Phys. A ... (IOP), New J. Phys. (IOP), Physics of Fluids (AIP)

Physics in the Letter? Is this Physics Letters, published by Elsevier? Or Physical Review Letters?
