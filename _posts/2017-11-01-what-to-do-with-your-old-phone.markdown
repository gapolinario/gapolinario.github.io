This [article][comp-world] has lots of great ideas
to keep an old phone still useful.

I use my old phone now mainly for Spotify playlists,
which I download previously, and as e-reader.
It also has Telegram installed, since the app does not
require a working phone number, because Telegram is great.

I would like to use it as remote control for my computer.
This is possible but memory-expensive. Both apps I tried,
bcVNC and Unified Remote, take about 70.0 MB of space,
and what I had was very limited. One has to install client
and server sides of these apps.

Other interesting options are:
- Make it a remote control (yes, a remote control)
- Desk calendar
- Gaming device
